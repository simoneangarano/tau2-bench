# Tau2 Domains

This folder contains the domains for the Tau2 project.

## Domain Structure

Each domain has its own folder with the following structure:

- `data_model.py`: Defines the data models for the domain. 
    - Implements a subclass of `DB` (e.g. `FlightDB(DB)`) which is the base class for all domain databases (defined in `tau2/environment/db.py`).
- `user_data_model.py`: Defines the data models for the user data for the domain. (Optional)
    - Implements a subclass of `DB` for the domain's user database.
- `tools.py`: Defines the tools for the domain. 
    - Implements a subclass of `ToolKitBase` (e.g. `AirlineTools(ToolKitBase)`) which is the base class for all domain toolkits (defined in `tau2/environment/toolkit.py`). 
- `user_tools.py`: Defines the user tools for the domain. (Optional)
    - Implements a subclass of `ToolKitBase` for user-facing tools. 
- `environment.py`: Defines the environment for the domain. 
    - Implements `get_environment()` function that returns an `Environment` instance for the domain.
    - Implements `get_tasks()` function that returns a list of tasks for the domain.
    - Implements `get_tasks_split()` function that returns a dictionary mapping split names to lists of task IDs.
- `utils.py`: Defines the utility functions for the domain (e.g. data paths).

## Data Storage

All the data for the domain is stored in `data/tau2/domains/<domain_name>` folder.
Should contain:
- `tasks.json`: A JSON file containing the tasks for the domain.
- `tasks_voice.json`: A JSON file containing the voice tasks for the domain.
- `split_tasks.json`: A JSON file containing the task splits for the domain.
    - The split file naming follows the pattern `split_<tasks_file_stem>.json` (e.g. `split_tasks.json` for `tasks.json`).
    - The task splits are defined as a dictionary mapping split names to lists of task IDs.
    - The task IDs are defined in the `tasks.json` file.
    - It must at minimum implement a task split called `base`. This will be the default task split.
- `policy.md`: A markdown file containing the policy for the domain.
- `db.json` or `db.toml`: A JSON or TOML file containing the database for the domain.
- `user_db.json` or `user_db.toml`: A JSON or TOML file containing the user database for the domain. (Optional)


## Tests
All the tests for the domain are stored in the `tests/test_domains/test_<domain_name>` folder.
- `test_tools_<domain_name>.py`: Contains tests for the tools for the domain.
- `test_user_tools_<domain_name>.py`: Contains tests for the user tools for the domain (if any)


To run tests:
```sh
pytest tests/test_domains/test_<domain_name>
```

## Registering your domain
To make it easy for people to use your domain, you need to register your `get_environment`, `get_tasks`, and `get_tasks_split` functions in Tau2 `registry.py` file.

In `registry.py`:
```python
from tau2.domains.your_domain.environment import get_environment as your_domain_get_environment
from tau2.domains.your_domain.environment import get_tasks as your_domain_get_tasks
from tau2.domains.your_domain.environment import get_tasks_split as your_domain_get_tasks_split
...
registry.register_domain(your_domain_get_environment, "your_domain_name")
registry.register_tasks(your_domain_get_tasks, "your_domain_name", get_task_splits=your_domain_get_tasks_split)
```
