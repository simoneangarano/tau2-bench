Voice Analysis for Tau Voice Experiments.

This module provides detailed voice/speech analysis following the same
architectural principles as performance_analysis.py:
- Each analysis outputs to a dedicated subdirectory
- Consistent pattern: raw.csv, analysis.csv, *.pdf
- Unified styling system

The foundation is the extraction of speech segments from simulation ticks,
with rich metadata for turn-taking, interruption, and timing analysis.

@dataclass
class VoiceQualityEvent:

    Unified event for voice quality analysis.

    This dataclass captures all event types that are shown on the speech timeline
    and used for computing voice quality metrics. Using a single event type ensures
    consistency between visualization and analysis.

    Event categories:
    1. Response events: Agent's response to user speech
       - "response": Agent responded (success)
       - "no_response": Agent failed to respond (error)

    2. Yield events: Agent yielding when user interrupts
       - "yield": Agent yielded to user interruption (success)
       - "no_yield": Agent failed to yield (error)

    1. response_rate: % of user turns that got an agent response
    2. response_latency_mean: Mean response latency (seconds)
    3. yield_rate: % of user interruptions where agent yielded
    4. yield_latency_mean: Mean yield latency (seconds)
    5. backchannel_error_rate: % of backchannels that incorrectly stopped agent
    6. vocal_tic_error_rate: % of vocal tics that incorrectly triggered agent
    7. non_directed_error_rate: % of non-directed speech that incorrectly triggered agent
