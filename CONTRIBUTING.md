new-stuff
```

## 🔧 Development Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tau2-bench.git
cd tau2-bench

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
tau2 check-data
```

### 2. Development Dependencies
The project uses several tools for code quality:
- **Ruff**: Linting and code formatting
- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **PDM**: Package management

### 3. Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your API keys for testing.

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_domains/  # Domain tests
pytest tests/test_agent.py  # Agent tests
pytest tests/test_environment.py  # Environment tests
```

### Test Requirements for PRs
- **Existing tests must pass**: All current tests should continue to pass
- **New functionality needs tests**: Add tests for new features or bug fixes
- **Domain contributions**: Include comprehensive domain-specific tests
- **Experimental code**: Basic smoke tests recommended but not required

### Test Coverage Guidelines
- **Core framework changes**: Aim for good test coverage of new functionality
- **Domain implementations**: Test all tools, tasks, and policy interactions
- **Bug fixes**: Include regression tests to prevent the bug from reoccurring

## 📋 Code Quality Standards

### Code Formatting and Linting
We use **Ruff** for both linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
make lint

# Format code
make format

# Auto-fix linting issues
make lint-fix

# Run both linting and formatting
make check-all
```

### Code Style Guidelines
- **Line length**: 88 characters (configured in pyproject.toml)
- **Import organization**: Use Ruff's import sorting
- **Type hints**: Encouraged for new code, especially in core framework
- **Docstrings**: Required for public APIs and complex functions

### Commit Message Guidelines
Write clear, concise commit messages:
```bash
# Good commit messages
feat: add memory system to agent base class
fix: resolve environment tool timeout issues
docs: update domain contribution guidelines
test: add integration tests for retail domain

# Avoid
fixed stuff
updates
wip
```

## 🎯 Specific Contribution Guidelines

### Domain Contributions

There are two types of domain contributions:

#### Core Domains (`src/tau2/domains/`)
Core domains are part of the official τ²-bench benchmark and are maintained by Sierra. Core domain contributions:
- Require thorough review and approval
- Must include complete implementation (tools, tasks, policy, tests)
- Are registered in the domain registry
- Contribute to official benchmark results and leaderboard

#### Community-Contributed Domains (`src/experiments/domains/`)
Community domains are contributed by external developers and live in the experiments directory. They:
- Are self-contained with their own data, tests, and documentation
- Are auto-discovered and registered with an `experimental:` prefix (e.g., `experimental:airline_sapconcur`)
- Can be used via CLI: `tau2 run --domain "experimental:<domain_name>" ...`
- Can include the original contributor's code for reference
- May be promoted to core domains after review and adoption

**Structure for community domains:**
```
src/experiments/domains/<domain_name>/
├── original/            # Original contributor's code (optional, for reference)
├── domain/              # Clean tau2-compatible implementation
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data_model.py    # Pydantic DB model
│   ├── tools.py         # ToolKit implementation
│   ├── environment.py   # get_environment() and get_tasks()
│   └── tests/           # Unit tests
├── data/                # Domain data (db.json, policy.md, tasks.json)
└── README.md            # Documentation and attribution
```

**Requirements for community domains:**
- **Attribution**: Proper credit to original contributors in README and source files
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with usage instructions
- **Self-contained data**: Include all data files within the domain directory
- **Basic tests**: Include unit tests for core functionality
- **Demo script**: Provide a demo.py for easy testing without registry integration

### Experimental Contributions
For other `src/experiments/` contributions (non-domain):
- **Self-contained**: Keep experimental code isolated within the experiments directory
- **Documentation**: Include detailed README explaining the experiment and usage
- **Dependencies**: Manage dependencies carefully to avoid conflicts with core framework
- **Status clarity**: Clearly mark experimental status and limitations

### Agent Contributions

There are two types of agent contributions:

#### Core Agents (`src/tau2/agent/`)
Core agents are part of the official tau2 framework and are maintained by Sierra. Core agent contributions:
- Require thorough review and approval
- Must implement `HalfDuplexAgent` or `FullDuplexAgent`
- Are registered in `src/tau2/registry.py`
- See `src/tau2/agent/README.md` for the full developer guide
