% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{icml2026} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2026} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}
\usepackage{xurl}  % Allow URLs to break at any character

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage{icml2026}

% For preprint, use
% \usepackage[preprint]{icml2026}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
% \usepackage[accepted]{icml2026}

  % style file will automatically remove it for you unless you've provided
  % the [accepted] option to the icml2026 package.

  % List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short) identifier you
  % will use later to specify author affiliations Academic affiliations
  % should list Department, University, City, Region, Country Industry
  % affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

  % You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order. Ideally, you
  % should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered in order of
  % appearance and this is the preferred way.

% Use ONE of the following lines. DO NOT remove the command.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
