\textbf{Accessibility.} Our ablation results show performance degradation with diverse accents, raising equity concerns: voice agents risk excluding users who might benefit most from voice interfaces. Evaluating under realistic conditions helps identify these gaps.

\textbf{Open and extensible.} We open-source \tauvoice{} as a fully configurable platform. Researchers can bring their own TTS, STT, voice agents, cascaded models and VAD implementations. All parameters are configurable: audio effects, voice personas, turn-taking policies, and the user simulator LLM. This modularity enables evaluation of new providers, languages, and domains without rebuilding infrastructure.

\textbf{Our position.} Transparent benchmarking under realistic conditions helps the community understand deployment readiness. Measuring where voice agents fail is a prerequisite for improving them.
