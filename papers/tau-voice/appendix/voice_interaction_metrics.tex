\section{Voice Interaction Metrics}
\label{app:voice-metrics}

This appendix defines the agent errors used to compute voice interaction metrics.

\paragraph{Timing thresholds.} Yield window: 2.0s (agent must stop within this time after user interruption). Selectivity windows: 1.0s for incorrect yields, 2.0s for incorrect responses.

\textbf{Error Type} & \textbf{Agent State} & \textbf{Trigger} & \textbf{Incorrect Behavior} & \textbf{Window} \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\textit{Turn-Taking}} \\
No-Response & Silent & User turn ends & No response & --- \\
No-Yield & Speaking & User interrupts & Keep speaking & 2.0s \\
Agent Interruption & Any & User speaking & Start speaking & --- \\
\midrule
\multicolumn{5}{l}{\textit{Selectivity}} \\
Backchannel Yield & Speaking & Backchannel & Stop speaking & 1.0s \\
Vocal Tic Yield & Speaking & Vocal tic & Stop speaking & 1.0s \\
Non-Directed Yield & Speaking & Non-directed speech & Stop speaking & 1.0s \\
Responds to Vocal Tic & Silent & Vocal tic & Start speaking & 2.0s \\
Responds to Non-Directed & Silent & Non-directed speech & Start speaking & 2.0s \\
